## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to make my css code neater, and how to use flexbox better. I also learned that I could link more than 1 CSS file to a single HTML file. I also learned how to write markdown xD

### Continued development

I am going to work more on learning CSS flexbox and get really good at it

### Useful resources
